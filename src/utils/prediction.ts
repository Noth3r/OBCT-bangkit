Remember, fish packs high-quality protein and tends to be lower in saturated fat and cholesterol compared to red meat. It's all about balance! Don't forget to team up with healthcare pros like dietitians and physicians for top-notch support. Mix it up with aerobic exercises like cycling or brisk walking and strength training to crush those weight loss goals and tone those muscles! Let's rock it! üí™ü•¶üêü",
